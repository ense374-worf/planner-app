## Project background/Business Opportunity
Many students are struggling with organizing their time scheduling, submitting assignments, and preparing for exams. Organizing a schedule is a skill that requires time management and more than some information on a table. Students need something to remind them of upcoming tasks. Also, adding a visual experience supports memorizing information for a longer time. There are many other solutions out there that attempt to solve students' problems with organizing their time and tasks, however, we are the students, and we are designing the solution that suits our needs to be more successful in our studies and academics.

Students have a lot on their plate. With 4, 5, or even 6 concurrent classes it can be easy to forget upcoming assignments and exams. What we want is a way for students to keep track of their busy schedules and remind them of upcoming due dates and exams. With our solution students could manage their time more effectively and be aware of upcoming due dates and important events such as midterms and final exams.
