## Project idea
Our idea is to create a solution for students that helps them to track their classes schedule, assignments, exams, and other tasks. Students also need a useful tool that is easy to reach out in preparing for the next assignment and for reminding them of due dates. Using the skills we have learned from both courses ense 374 and cs 215, our team members will be able to develop our web-based solution.

## Project background/Business Opportunity
As a business need, many students are struggling with organizing their time scheduling, submitting assignments on time, and preparing for exams. Organizing classes scheduled is a skill that requires practicing time management and more than some information on a table, students need something to remind them as well, so that's more than just a timetable. Also, adding a visual experience supports memorizing information for a longer time. There are many other solutions out there that attempt to solve students' problems with organizing their time and tasks, however, we are the students, and we are designing the solution that suits our needs to be more successful in our studies and academics.

Students have a lot on their plate. With 4, 5, or even 6 concurrent classes it can be easy to forget upcoming assignments and exams. What we want is a way for students to keep track of their busy schedules and remind them of upcoming due dates and exams. With our solution students could manage their time more effectively and be aware of upcoming due dates and important events such as midterms and final exams.
